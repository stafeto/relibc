//! This crate provides a guarding mechanism for memory, with an interface that is in some ways
//! similar to `core::pin::Pin`.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! What this crate attempts to solve, is the problem that data races can occur for memory that is
//! shared with another process or the kernel (via `io_uring` for instance). If the memory is still
//! shared when the original thread continues to execute after a system call for example, the
//! original buffer can still be accessed while the system call allows the handler to keep using
//! the memory. This does not happen with traditional blocking syscalls; the kernel will only
//! access the memory during the syscall, when the process cannot temporarily do anything else.
//!
//! However, for more advanced asynchronous interfaces such as `io_uring` that never copy memory,
//! the memory can still be used once the system call has started, which can lead to data races
//! between two actors sharing memory. To prevent this data race, it is not possible to:
//!
//! 1) Read the memory while it is being written to by the kernel, or write to the memory while it
//!    is being read by the kernel. This is exactly like Rust's aliasing rules: we can either allow
//!    both the kernel and this process to read a buffer, for example in the system call
//!    _write(2)_, we can temporarily give the kernel exclusive ownership one or more buffers when
//!    the kernel is going to write to them, or we can avoid sharing memory at all with the kernel,
//!    __but we cannot let either actor have mutable access while the other has any access at
//!    all.__ (_aliasing invariant_)
//! 2) Reclaim the memory while it is being read from or written to by the kernel. This is as
//!    simple as it sounds: we simply do not want the buffers to be used for other purposes, either
//!    by returning the memory to the heap, where it can be allocated simply so that the kernel can
//!    overwrite it when it is not supposed to, or it can corrupt stack variables. (_reclamation
//!    invariant_)
//!
//! The term "kernel" does not necessarily have to be the other actor that the memory is shared
//! with; on Redox for example, the `io_uring` interface can work solely between regular userspace
//! processes. Additionally, although being a somewhat niche case, this can also be used for safe
//! wrappers protecting memory for DMA in device drivers, with a few additional restrictions
//! (regarding cache coherency) to make that work.
//!
//! This buffer sharing logic does unfortunately not play very well with the current asynchronous
//! ecosystem, where almost all I/O is done using regular borrowed slices, and references are
//! merely borrows which are cancellable _at any time_, even by leaking. This functions perfectly
//! when you use _synchronous_ (but non-blocking) system calls where either the process or the
//! kernel can execute at a time. In contrast, `io_uring` is _asynchronous_, meaning that the
//! kernel can read and write to buffers, _while our program is executing_. Therefore, a future
//! that locally stores an array, aliased by the kernel in `io_uring`, cannot stop the kernel from
//! using the memory again in any reasonable way, if the future were to be `Drop`ped, without
//! blocking indefinitely. What is even worse, is that futures can be leaked at any time, and
//! arrays allocated on the stack can also be dropped, when the memory is still in use by the
//! kernel, as a buffer to write data from e.g. a socket. If a (mutable) buffer on the stack is
//! then reused later for regular variables... arbitrary program corruption!
//!
//! What we need in order to solve these two complications, is some way to be able to mark a memory
//! region as both "borrowed by the kernel" (mutably or immutably), and "undroppable". Since the
//! Rust borrow checker is smart, any mutable reference with a lifetime that is shorter than
//! `'static`, can trivially be leaked, and the pointer can be used again. This rules out any
//! reference of lifetime `'a` that `'static` outlives, as those may be used again outside of the
//! borrow, potentially mutably. Immutable static references are however completely harmless, since
//! they cannot be dropped nor accessed mutably, and immutable aliasing is always permitted.
//!
//! Consequently, all buffers that are going to be used in safe code, must be owned. This either
//! means heap-allocated objects (since we can assume that the heap as a whole has the `'static`
//! lifetime, and allocations stay forever, until deallocated explicitly), buffer pools which
//! themselves have a guarding mechanism, and static references (both mutable and immutable). We
//! can however allow borrowed data as well, but because of the semantics around lifetimes, and the
//! very fact that the compiler has no idea that the kernel is also involved, that requires unsafe
//! code.
//!
//! Consider reading ["Mental experiments with
//! `io_uring`"](https://vorner.github.io/2019/11/03/io-uring-mental-experiments.html), and ["Notes
//! on `io-uring`"](https://without.boats/blog/io-uring/) for more information about these
//! challenges.
//!
//! # Interface
//!
//! The way `guard_trait` solves this, is by adding two simple traits: `Guarded` and `GuardedMut`.
//! `Guarded` is automatically implemented for every pointer type that implements `Deref`,
//! `StableDeref` and `'static`. Similarly, `GuardedMut` is implemented under the same conditions,
//! and provided that the pointer implements `DerefMut`. A consequence of this, is that nearly all
//! owned container types, such as `Arc`, `Box`, `Vec`, etc., all implement the traits, and can
//! thus be used with completion-based interfaces.
//!
//! For scenarios where it is impossible to ensure at the type level, that a certain pointer
//! follows the guard invariants, `AssertSafe` also exists, but is unsafe to initialize.
//!
//! Buffers can also be mapped in a self-referencial way, similar to how `owning-ref` works, using
//! `GuardedExt::map` and `GuardedMutExt::map_mut`. This is especially important when slice
//! indexing is needed, as the only way to limit the number of bytes to do I/O with, generally is
//! to shorten the slice.
